Instructions to run code:
Enter "transactions" directory and run "g++ -std=c++17 -g -o transaction main.cpp inmemoryDB.cpp" in the command line.
Run ./transaction
Follows example in assignment pdf.

Overall, I thought this was a great assignment! I found it to be simple yet informative about data processing and storage. To make this an official assignment I think going more specific into what each function does could be helpful.
